There are 3 minimum files which are dbf, shx, shp. Here dbf file is database file to store attributes.We cannot directly import shape file in Power bi Desktop. 
We need Topojson format or we need to convert to csv file before importing to Power BI.
To converting to Topojson file, we have many tools like mapshaper.In mapshaper, we can convert projections.
